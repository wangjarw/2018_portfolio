        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p class="about-para">I am a <em class="intro-emphasis">visual designer with a strong interest in doing graphic design and videography </em> using Adobe Suites. Born with a
          Taiwanese background, I value the idea of multiculturalism. Hence, I have several design experiences
          with organizations and programs who mainly work with international newcomers. During the design
          process, I am interested in <em class="intro-emphasis">doing research, content strategy, storytelling through sketching or illustrations, storyboarding and project management.</em>
        </p>
        <p class="about-para">My current goal is to <em class="intro-emphasis">learn more about UX/UI design, web design (html/css) and game design (java and Unity)</em> that can potentially enriches myself as a designer. <em class="intro-emphasis">This website is actually coded by myself </em>and I am still really passionate on learning more about this design field.
        </p>
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p class="about-para">I am in love with teaching and learning along with other people. Hence, I have several experiences in teaching,
          including being a teaching assistant and participating in school funded Techbyte team which is a program that
          engages new designers to learn design software and programming. Moreover, I am also passionate in learning
          about different cultures. Currently, I am self learning Japanese and Korean.</p>
